The CHIP-8 has many kinds of registers:

#### General Purpose Data Registers ###

16 1 byte data registers (V0 to VF)
Many ins manipulate them using a 4bits index to indicate which VX to use

VF also used as flag reg for some ins.

### Program Counter ###

PC: 2 bytes, but only 12bits necessary
Contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.

### Address Register ###

I: 2 bytes, but only 12 bits necessary.
Contains some memory address (cannot be stored in VX).
A few instructions manipulates it to read/write data to address in I.

### Stack Pointer ###

SP: variable size. (1 byte in implem)
Used to point to the top of the stack (more infos at stack.txt)
Incremented / Decrement by call / ret instructions.

### Delay Timer ###

DT: 1 byte, decremented at 60 hertz, until it reaches 0

### Sound Timer ###

ST: 1 byte, decremented at 60 hertz, until reaches 0
Audio system produces a beep when ST != 0



All registers are intialized ty 0, expect PC which is usually set at 0x200 (begin of the ROM)

Timers decremented at 60 hertz. decremented by one every 1/60th second
